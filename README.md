Empower
=======

**Please note this package is still in development, it may change a lot before mid-June, so please be patient.**

This is needed for other packages made by myself to function fully, as it contains a lot of generic code that would be repeated otherwise.

## Usage

This package is not recommended for standalone use - it is used to store common features among all other packages I'm creating for Laravel 4.

## Installation

You can install this package via composer by adding the below to your composer.json file:

    "sorora/empower" : "1.*"

Once you have installed the package (by running composer update or composer install), you **should** publish the configuration to your main project, so future updates do not override your config.

## Configuration Options

Coming soon...
