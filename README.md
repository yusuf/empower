Empower
=======

This is needed for other packages made by myself to function fully, as it contains a lot of generic code that would be repeated otherwise.

# Usage

This package is not recommended for standalone use - it is used to store common features among all other packages I'm creating for Laravel 4.

# Installation

You can install this package via composer by adding the below to your composer.json file:

`"sorora/empower" : "1.*"
